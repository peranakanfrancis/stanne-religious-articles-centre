  title : "Grandmother of Hope"
  content : "Saint Anne is the mother of Mary, the woman who gave birth to Jesus by Virgin Birth. The Angel Gabriel came to Mary and told her that she would give birth to the Son of God. Saint Anne had promised that she would give her child to the service of God, and she kept her holy vow. When Mary was three years old, her parents brought her to the Temple and gave her to the service of the Temple. They did not see her again.

  Although she had wanted a child so badly, Saint Anne knew that she had to honor her promise to the Lord. Saint Anne and Joachim would not be able to raise the child since Mary needed to be raised in order to become the mother of Jesus Christ."
