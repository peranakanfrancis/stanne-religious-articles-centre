July 26th is the feast of St. Anne, grandmother of Jesus and mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As with so many other “extra-scriptural” aspects of our faith, devotions are like beautiful decorations, comforts, touchstones in the annual cycle of the Liturgical Calendar. It is humanizing for us (who need all the help we can get) to cultivate friendships and recourse to the saints. And who wouldn’t want a relationship with The Ultimate Jewish Grandmother?

Saint Anne is a powerful intercessor, combining the fortitude of age and the tender solicitude of motherhood and grandmotherhood. How sweet must she have been, the mother of our life, our sweetness and our hope, as we describe Mary, herself, in the beautiful Hail, Holy Queen! Here are just a few ways we can relate to St. Anne and beg her intercession, mother of the mother of God, grandmother of Jesus.

### Intercessor for vocations

St. Anne is like the dark, fertile soil from which vows, promises, and commitments are made. Ask her to pray for you to hear God’s call to your particular vocation. Ask her to lead you gently towards His will and to protect you – as she protected her own daughter – until God’s will is manifest. If you are called to marriage, invoke St. Anne’s intercession to find your future spouse and to fortify him or her in virtue, that you might be ready to see, to love, and to commit to each other. Ask her to protect and strengthen you in your vocation if it’s already decided.

### Intercessor for children and grandchildren

In these fraught times, mothers and grandmothers naturally worry about the well-being of children. As with St. Monica, St. Anne is a wonderful go-between for the prayers to God on behalf of your children and grandchildren. From her special vantage point in heaven, she sees your worries and the dangers faced by young people, but she is firmly anchored in the peace and promises of God and Our Lady to take care of all the little ones.

### Intercessor for wives and mothers

As a wife or mother, you can turn to St. Anne, faithful spouse of St. Joachim, for help in carrying out your duties virtuously. For men as husbands and/or sons, ask St. Anne to help you love your wife or mother better. She is the wisest and kindest of intercessors after the Blessed Virgin Mary, and she desires to intercede for families in these days of great threats against the family.

### Intercessor for expectant mothers

According to tradition, Sts. Anne and Joachim prayed fervently for many years for the gift of a baby before the arrival of Mary, the Immaculate Conception. Like any loving grandmother, St. Anne is eager to pray for pregnant mothers, for safe pregnancies and deliveries.

### Intercessor for workers

As traditional patroness of miners, St. Anne’s care for those particularly in dangerous lines of work is a natural association for us, today. St. Anne, watch over those who take physical risks to provide the rest of us with our various needs and comforts. We thank God for them and place them under your special protection.

### Intercessor for the elderly

It is said that St. Anne was quite elderly by the time she and St. Joachim were blessed with a child. In an age when the elderly are often shunted out of sight, whether into distant nursing homes or – worse – euthanized for lack of “usefulness,” St. Anne reminds us of the wisdom, love, and being-vs-doing beauty of the gift of old age. Ask her to pray for your own elderly relatives, neighbors, and especially for those who have been abandoned and have no one to visit or pray for them.

### Intercessor for those without children

St. Anne has a heart for the childless. Her fidelity through years of unanswered prayers for a child reminds us that God always knows, always loves, and never abandons us. Whether in sadness, in loneliness, in regret, turn to St. Anne for comfort and company. Pray to her for the children who’ve been abandoned in these godless times, for the victims of abortion, and for orphans. God has an important job for you, even if it is not biological or adoptive parenthood. Ask St. Anne to help you to discern and desire that unique job for His greater glory.

### Intercessor for patience

In a “culture of now,” St. Anne can help us to wait patiently. Conditioned as we are to receive instant gratification at the click of a button or the swipe of a credit card, we all need help in slowing down, resting and sitting still. Ask her to teach you to grow in gentleness and patience, after her example.

### Intercessor for those trying to conceive

If waiting in hope and fidelity to prayer can end in the world’s greatest gift to humanity – the Theotokos – then we who pray for the gift of a baby in our marriages can persevere in hope and beg her intercession. Good Saint Anne, take our prayers to Mary, your beloved daughter, and to Jesus, Our Lord, for the joyful gift of a child, for the greater glory of God and for the hope and promotion of Christian family life.

### Prayer to St. Anne
> Good St. Anne, Grandmother of Jesus and Grandmother to us all, with our hearts bruised by countless sufferings, we turn to you. With patience and gentleness, guide us. May our prayer, united with yours and that of your Daughter Mary, lead us to the merciful Heart of Jesus, where we may find healing, comfort, strength and hope.

> Lead us, good St. Anne, that we may discover the Heart of Jesus and there obtain the favors we seek.

> (Pause and silently make your request.)

> And blessed by His infinite Mercy, help us to live with mercy towards our brothers and sisters. Thank you, Grandmother St. Anne, for your help, intercessions and favors. Amen
