### Intercessor for wives and mothers
As a wife or mother, you can turn to St. Anne, faithful spouse of St. Joachim, for help in carrying out your duties virtuously. For men as husbands and/or sons, ask St. Anne to help you love your wife or mother better. She is the wisest and kindest of intercessors after the Blessed Virgin Mary, and she desires to intercede for families in these days of great threats against the family.
