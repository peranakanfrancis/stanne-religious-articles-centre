### Intercessor for those trying to conceive
If waiting in hope and fidelity to prayer can end in the world’s greatest gift to humanity – the Theotokos – then we who pray for the gift of a baby in our marriages can persevere in hope and beg her intercession. Good Saint Anne, take our prayers to Mary, your beloved daughter, and to Jesus, Our Lord, for the joyful gift of a child, for the greater glory of God and for the hope and promotion of Christian family life.
