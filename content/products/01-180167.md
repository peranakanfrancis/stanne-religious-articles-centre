### Intercessor for those without children
St. Anne has a heart for the childless. Her fidelity through years of unanswered prayers for a child reminds us that God always knows, always loves, and never abandons us. Whether in sadness, in loneliness, in regret, turn to St. Anne for comfort and company. Pray to her for the children whoâ€™ve been abandoned in these godless times, for the victims of abortion, and for orphans. God has an important job for you, even if it is not biological or adoptive parenthood. Ask St. Anne to help you to discern and desire that unique job for His greater glory.
