### Intercessor for vocations
St. Anne is like the dark, fertile soil from which vows, promises, and commitments are made. Ask her to pray for you to hear God’s call to your particular vocation. Ask her to lead you gently towards His will and to protect you – as she protected her own daughter – until God’s will is manifest. If you are called to marriage, invoke St. Anne’s intercession to find your future spouse and to fortify him or her in virtue, that you might be ready to see, to love, and to commit to each other. Ask her to protect and strengthen you in your vocation if it’s already decided.
