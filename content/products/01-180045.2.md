### Intercessor for the elderly
It is said that St. Anne was quite elderly by the time she and St. Joachim were blessed with a child. In an age when the elderly are often shunted out of sight, whether into distant nursing homes or – worse – euthanized for lack of “usefulness,” St. Anne reminds us of the wisdom, love, and being-vs-doing beauty of the gift of old age. Ask her to pray for your own elderly relatives, neighbors, and especially for those who have been abandoned and have no one to visit or pray for them.
