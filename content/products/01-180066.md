### Intercessor for children and grandchildren
In these fraught times, mothers and grandmothers naturally worry about the well-being of children. As with St. Monica, St. Anne is a wonderful go-between for the prayers to God on behalf of your children and grandchildren. From her special vantage point in heaven, she sees your worries and the dangers faced by young people, but she is firmly anchored in the peace and promises of God and Our Lady to take care of all the little ones.
