### Intercessor for expectant mothers
According to tradition, Sts. Anne and Joachim prayed fervently for many years for the gift of a baby before the arrival of Mary, the Immaculate Conception. Like any loving grandmother, St. Anne is eager to pray for pregnant mothers, for safe pregnancies and deliveries.
