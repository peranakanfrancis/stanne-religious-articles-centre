# Product Short Description
shortDescription: "St. Anne is like the dark, fertile soil from which vows, promises, and commitments are made. Ask her to pray for you to hear God’s call to your particular vocation. Ask her to lead you gently towards His will and to protect you – as she protected her own daughter – until God’s will is manifest."

We ask for Saint Anne's intercession in all things regarding motherhood and household as she is the patron saint of housekeepers and mothers. Anne is the mother of Our Blessed Mother Mary and the grandmother of Jesus Christ.
