### Shipping Guidelines
We ship all orders via J&T Express, therefore we must have a physical address as our courier service provider cannot ship to a PO Box. We ship all orders placed before 3PM the next day unless an item you have ordered is out of stock. If we are out of stock of any item you have ordered we will call you or send you an email and give you the following options:

- Wait for the missing item to be restocked and receive your complete order (We will give you a timeframe for receipt of the missing item)
- Receive credit for the missing item and have the balance of your order shipped that day
- A complete refund of your order.

___We ship all of our orders in discrete unmarked boxes to ensure your utmost privacy.___

### International Shipping
Please note: we curretly **DO NOT** ship outside of Malaysia.

### Refused Shipments
If you decide to refuse any shipments from St Anne's Religious Articles Centre, you are responsible for the original shipping charges to you, any duties, taxes and/or customs charges that are incurred on the package (on both the original and return shipments) and the cost of returning the package to St Anne's Religious Articles Centre. This amount will be subtracted from your merchandise refund.

### Shipment Damages and/or Shortages
Should packages being received be damaged, broken or opened resulting in shortage of merchandise in that particular package the delivery driver must mark this on his or her delivery sheet before you sign as having received the shipment. Immediately file a claim with carrier. Retain the merchandise and packaging material for inspection by carrier. You cannot recover for damages without these items. Packaging is done very carefully, however due to bulky packaging items can go unnoticed between the packaging materials. It is important you check immediately that you received all the items listed as shipped on your packing slip before discarding packaging. If you see that an item and/or items are missing you must file a claim to St Anne's Religious Articles Centre within 3 days of receipt of order.

### Return Policy
We accept returns. You can return unopened items in the original packaging within 7 days of your purchase with receipt or proof of purchase for a refund or exchange.

### Restocking Fees
There is a 10% restocking charge on each order unless fault or error is ours. Shipping fees will not be refunded unless fault or error is ours and authorization was given. Please open your parcels immediately and inspect for damage or shortages. If your order has been processed/picked and you request the order to be canceled before it ships there is a 15% restocking fee.
